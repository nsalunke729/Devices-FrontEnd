# Step 1: Use Node.js to install dependencies and build the React app
FROM node:18-alpine AS build

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to install dependencies
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy all project files into the container
COPY . .

# Build the React app (output goes into the 'build' folder)
RUN npm run build

# Step 2: Use Nginx to serve the built React app
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy the built React files from the previous step to the Nginx folder
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80 to serve the React app
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx to serve the React app
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]

#build and run
docker build -t my-react-app .
docker run -p 3000:80 my-react-app
